# Random Quote Machine

This is my solution to the [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project under [freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/). 

This solution uses HTML and CSS for basic structure and styling, respectively. It also uses React to: (1) fetch random quotes (and their corresponding authors) from the Type.fit API, and; (2) render the results onto the webpage.
