# Random Quote Machine

View the project [here](https://unruffled-hugle-85c581.netlify.app/).

This is my solution for the [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine) project under [freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/).

This solution uses HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap5 for basic structure and styling. It also uses React to fetch random quotes (and their corresponding authors) from the [Type.fit](https://type.fit/) API, as well as render the results onto the webpage.

As this project was done for learning purposes, it referenced the styling done in the [example provided](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/qRZeGZ). Also referenced [Landon Schlangen's solution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyZzRSTZQ2Y).
